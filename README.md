ðŸŽ“ Student Result Analysis
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student performance data to uncover patterns and insights based on demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, and marital status, and how these influence academic performance in Math, Reading, and Writing.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The dataset used is student_scores.csv, which contains the following key features:
Gender
EthnicGroup
ParentEduc (Parent's Level of Education)
ParentMaritalStatus
MathScore
ReadingScore
WritingScore

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Analyze the demographic distribution of students.
Examine gender and ethnic group representation.
Investigate the impact of parental education and marital status on academic scores.
Detect outliers in Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
Visualize trends and patterns using plots and heatmaps.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Gender Distribution: The dataset has more female students than male.
Parental Education: Students generally perform better when parents have higher levels of education.
Parental Marital Status: No major impact observed on student performance based on marital status.
Outliers: Box plots revealed potential outliers in Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
Ethnic Group Distribution: Group C is the most represented, followed by Groups D and B. Group A has the fewest students.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations Used
Count Plots â€“ for gender and ethnic distribution.
Pie Charts â€“ to represent proportions of ethnic groups.
Heatmaps â€“ to show average scores by parental education and marital status.
Box Plots â€“ to detect outliers in subject-wise performance.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python
Pandas â€“ data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ data visualization
